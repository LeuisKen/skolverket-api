# Skolverket API
This is a project I'm currently working on to create an open API solution for Skolverket's open data. Their data is currently packaged in several TAR archives available for download, that are updated every night.

As this is a work-in-progress there will be a lot of changes in the near future. But feel free to contribute however you see fit.
